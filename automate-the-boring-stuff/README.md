#   PYTHON
Python is both a programming language and the interpreter software that reads source code.

##  Part I: Programming Fundamentals

### Chapter 1: Python Basics 
Covers expressions, the most basic type of Python instruction, and how to use the Python interactive shell software to experiment with code.

#### Entering Expressions into the Interactive Shell
        >>> 2 + 2
        4
        >>>
In Python, 2 + 2 is called an expression,


### Chapter 2: if-else and Flow Control 
Explains how to make programs decide which instructions to execute so that your code can intelligently respond to different conditions.

### Chapter 3: Loops 
Explains how to make programs repeat instructions a set number of times, or for as long as a certain condition holds.

### Chapter 4: Functions 
Instructs you on how to define your own functions so that you can organize your code into more manageable chunks.

### Chapter 5: Debugging 
Shows how to use Python’s various bug-finding and bug-fixing tools.

### Chapter 6: Lists 
Introduces the list data type and explains how to organize data.

### Chapter 7: Dictionaries and Structuring Data 
Introduces the dictionary data type and shows you more powerful ways to organize data.

### Chapter 8: Strings and Text Editing 
Covers working with text data (called strings in Python).

##  Part II: Automating Tasks

### Chapter 9: Text Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions 
Covers how Python can manipulate strings and search for text patterns with regular expressions.

### Chapter 10: Reading and Writing Files 
Explains how your program can read the contents of text files and save information to files on your hard drive.

### Chapter 11: Organizing Files 
Shows how Python can copy, move, rename, and delete large numbers of files much faster than a human user can. Also explains compressing and decompressing files.

### Chapter 12: Designing and Deploying Command Line Programs 
Explains how you can package your Python programs to easily run them either on your own computer or on co-workers’ computers.

### Chapter 13: Web Scraping 
Shows how to write programs that can automatically download web pages and parse them for information. This is called web scraping.

### Chapter 14: Excel Spreadsheets 
Covers programmatically manipulating Excel spreadsheets so that you don’t have to read them. This is helpful when the number of documents you have to analyze is in the hundreds or thousands.

### Chapter 15: Google Sheets 
Covers how to read and update Google Sheets, a popular web-based spreadsheet application, using Python.

### Chapter 16: SQLite Databases 
Explains how to use relational databases with SQLite, the tiny but powerful open source database that comes with Python.

### Chapter 17: PDF and Word Documents 
Covers programmatically reading Word and PDF documents.

### Chapter 18: CSV, JSON, and XML Files 
Continues to explain how to programmatically manipulate documents, now discussing the data serialization formats CSV, JSON, and XML.

### Chapter 19: Keeping Time, Scheduling Tasks, and Launching Programs 
Explains how Python programs handle time and dates and how to schedule your computer to perform tasks at certain times. Also shows how your Python programs can launch non-Python programs.

### Chapter 20: Sending Email, Texts, and Push Notifications 
Explains how to write programs that can notify you via email or mobile communications, or send these messages to others.

### Chapter 21: Making Graphs and Manipulating Images 
Explains how to programmatically manipulate images, such as JPEG or PNG files, and work with the Matplotlib graph-making library.

### Chapter 22: Recognizing Text in Images 
Covers how to extract text from images and scanned documents for further processing with the PyTesseract package.

### Chapter 23: Controlling the Keyboard and Mouse 
Explains how to programmatically control the mouse and keyboard to automate clicks and key presses.

### Chapter 24: Text-to-Speech and Speech Recognition Engines 
Covers how to use advanced computer science packages to not only generate spoken audio from text, but also convert spoken audio to text.
